# AI Maze-Solving Robot

> **IN DEVELOPMENT**

This project is currently in development. The information below is subject to change as development progresses.

This project aims to create a web-based simulation of a robot that learns to solve a maze using artificial intelligence (AI). The robot, represented as a square on a canvas, will navigate through the maze, learning from its mistakes and improving its performance over time.

## Project Description

The AI Maze-Solving Robot project uses a combination of Python for the backend and HTML5/JavaScript for the frontend. The robot's movements and obstacle detection logic are implemented in Python, while the maze and the robot are drawn on an HTML canvas using JavaScript.

The robot learns to navigate the maze using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. It receives feedback based on its behavior, and uses this feedback to improve its performance. The goal is for the robot to learn the most efficient path through the maze, reducing unnecessary routes and solving the maze in the shortest possible time.
